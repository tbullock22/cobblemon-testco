accessWidener	v2	named

# Cobblemon makes use of the v2 protocol for access wideners. This allows for plugins
# and mods depending on Cobblemon to apply theses wideners to their own environments,
# avoiding illegal access errors where they would otherwise not apply on production.
#
# For all entries, unless otherwise noted, prefix each typical access keywork with
# "transitive-" to ensure they will extend down to dev environments.
