    /**
     * Calculates catch rates based on the following mechanics:
     *
     * Gen 3/4: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate#Capture_method_.28Generation_III-IV.29
     * Gen 8: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate#Capture_method_.28Generation_VIII.29
     *
     * Due to pokemon making pokemon captures on Gen 5 and higher much easier, this implementation
     * calculates catch rate in a modified manner to increase difficulty. First, it calculates the base capture
     * rate via the Gen 3/4 mechanics. This involves the following variables:
     * - The pokemon's maximum HP at its current level
     * - The pokemon's current HP
     * - The base catch rate of the pokemon
     * - Modifiers which directly affect the catch rate
     * - A status inflicted on the pokemon
     *
     * These values are used in accordance with the Gen 3/4 modified catch rate formula, and are then
     * additionally ran through difficulty modifiers introduced in generation 8. These modifiers can be
     * described as the following:
     * - bonusLevel: Based on the level of the target wild pokemon, this value only applies to PokÃ©mon bellow level 20.
     * - difficulty: A difficulty factor, modified to scale with your own pokemon's level, which is directly affected
     * by the level of the wild pokemon against your own.
     *
     * Normally, the difficulty factor simply checks if the level of your pokemon is less than the target wild
     * pokemon. If so, your capture rate is immediately reduced by 90%, making it far more difficult for a
     * pokeball to succeed in capture. In this implementation, the mechanic scales to your level, so the closer
     * your pokemon is to the opponent's level, the better the odds. So, if the target pokemon is level 100 and
     * your pokemon is level 95, you'd only face a 10% reduction. Now, in the event your pokemon is level 5 and
     * the target is level 10, you'd have a 50% reduction in catch rate potential. This should see a better
     * difficulty factor for users who simply start and catch the highest level pokemon they can find immediately,
     * effectively skipping the entire starting phase.
     *
     * In the event you throw a pokeball out of battle, the difficulty factor will automatically default to the base
     * 90% reduction.
     *
     * Finally, if your pokemon has a level higher than that of the target, a maximum multiplier of 1 will be applied,
     * which simply forces this modifier to act as a no-op.
